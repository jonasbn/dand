Revision history for WWW-DanDomain

$Id$

1.00    Major release, 17.02.2010 update not required

New requirements met. DanDomain offers IP authorization instead of credential
based authentication and authorization. So we need not crawl to get to our
target as prior versions have done.

So a Factory pattern has been implemented using WWW::DanDomain as the factory.

This means that based on the parameters provided to the constructor one of two
objects are returned.

- WWW::DanDomain::NoAuth, if no credentials are provided IP authorization is
  expected

- WWW::DanDomain::Auth, with credentials normal authorization and authentication
  is expected

Introduced a SUPER class for the two new implementation classes mentioned above.

  failing
